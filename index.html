<p>Cornell's Ithaca campus and New York City-based Weill Medical campus are only 231 miles away.  Sending large files 
between them should be really fast right?  But hey.  Driving your car into the middle of Manhattan is not fast, is it?<br>
The fact is, there is a lot of infrastructure standing in the way.</p>

<p>Enter CoSciN!  Using state of the art Software Defined Networking (SDN) technology, CoSciN is an expert on the 
roads for you.  Coordinating between three traffic paths, CoSciN figures the least-used path at five minute intervals and 
redirects traffic based on them.  And it does this transparently.  Researchers simply send files like they normally
do and CoSciN takes care of the rest.</p>

<p>And how much faster is it?  It cuts the transfer time of multi-terabyte files from weeks to hours.  For huge dataset
applications like genomics, this is a huge difference.  Not having to worry about transfer times and scheduling, 
researchers are free to do what they're best at ... research! </p>
